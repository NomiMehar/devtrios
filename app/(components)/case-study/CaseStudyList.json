    "challenge": "Fairagora's previous website lacked a clear service structure, loaded slowly on mobile, and wasn't optimised for search visibility. Key service pages were difficult to discover, limiting engagement from partners and stakeholders.",
    "solution": "We rebuilt the website with a scalable architecture focused on performance, SEO-ready foundations, and mobile-first UX. The project included restructuring service pages, improving information hierarchy, and optimising the site for speed and crawlability.",
    "outcomes": [
      "Page load times improved by approximately 35–45% across key pages",
      "Clear service structuring increased engagement on priority content",
      "SEO foundations enabled stronger visibility for targeted sustainability and consulting terms",
      "The site is now easier to manage, scale, and expand as Fairagora grows"

    "closingText": "This approach reflects how we build websites designed for long-term performance, not short-term launches."
